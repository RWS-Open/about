Details about what RWS Open.

First, welcome to RWS Open! This is an Open Source initiative to help RWS customers and partners get the most out of RWS software products.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Is the software here licensed differently than RWS products?</h2>
Yes! All of the software here is Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) so it's very different than the enterprise license that you have for your RWS products.

<h2>Can I just install the sample code myself?</h2>
Of course. Where applicable, we'll make notes of which connectors are a little more involved and where we suggest getting some time from RWS Professional Services or Partners for help.

<h2>What is the support model?</h2>
Since all of the connectors are open source they are unsupported. However both RWS Professional Services and our Partners can provide support as part of an engagement.

<h2>I found and fixed a problem in the code. What should I do?</h2>
Please create a pull request. Our tech team will evaluate the fix and will roll it into the main branch.

<h2>I have some code that I would like to contribute.</h2>
Reach out to your Account Executive or Solutions Consultant and we'd be happy to help!
